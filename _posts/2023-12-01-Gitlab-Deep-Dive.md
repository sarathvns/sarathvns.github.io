### Pipeline Structure
In GitLab, a CI/CD pipeline is a series of processes (jobs) that are defined in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. A pipeline can be divided into multiple stages, each containing one or more jobs. The stages are executed in the order they are defined.

### Key Components
- **Jobs:** The most fundamental element of a pipeline, representing a set of commands to be executed.
- **Stages:** Groups of jobs that run in a particular sequence.
- **Scripts:** Commands that are executed in each job.
- **Environment Variables:** Dynamic elements that can influence the behavior of jobs and scripts.

For a comprehensive understanding, visit [GitLab's Pipeline and Jobs documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/).

## Stages, Jobs, and Artifacts in GitLab CI/CD

### Stages
Stages define the order of execution for groups of jobs. Common stages include build, test, and deploy.

### Jobs
Jobs are used to define what to do in each stage. For example, a job can be used to compile code, run tests, or deploy software.

### Artifacts
Artifacts are files generated by a job that can be passed to subsequent stages. They can include compiled code, test results, or any other necessary files.

To learn more about stages, jobs, and artifacts, check [GitLab's documentation on pipeline artifacts](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/job_artifacts.html).

## Managing Pipeline Dependencies and Caching

### Pipeline Dependencies
Dependencies in GitLab CI/CD allow jobs to depend on the artifacts of previous jobs. You can specify which artifacts a job needs, reducing the transfer of unnecessary data and speeding up the pipeline.

### Caching
Caching is used to speed up pipeline execution by reusing files (like dependencies) between different runs or jobs. Itâ€™s particularly useful for reducing time spent on downloading and installing dependencies.

For more details on managing dependencies and caching, see [GitLab's documentation on caching](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/caching/).
