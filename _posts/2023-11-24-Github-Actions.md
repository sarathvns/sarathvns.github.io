**Objective**: Introduce GitHub Actions and its importance in modern software development.

## What are GitHub Actions?
GitHub Actions are a feature provided by GitHub that allows for automation of workflows within your software development process. This feature enables you to automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right within your GitHub repository.

## Basic Concepts
- **Workflows**: Automated processes that you set up in your GitHub repository. They are defined by a YAML file and can be triggered by various GitHub events.
- **Events**: Specific activities in your GitHub repository that trigger a workflow. Common events include `push`, `pull_request`, `workflow_dispatch` and `schedule`.
- **Jobs**: A set of steps in a workflow that are executed on the same runner. Jobs can run in parallel or be dependent on the outcome of a previous job.
- **Steps**: Individual tasks that run commands in a job. A step can be either an action or a shell command.
- **Runners**: Servers that execute your workflows when they are triggered. Runners can be hosted by GitHub or you can host your own.

## Benefits of Using GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- **Automation**: Automate your build, test, and deployment processes, making them more efficient and consistent.
- **Integration**: Easily integrate with GitHub repositories, simplifying the setup process for CI/CD pipelines.
- **Customization**: Customize workflows to match your development process, whether simple or complex.
- **Community and Ecosystem**: Access a vast marketplace of actions developed by the GitHub community to extend your workflows.
- **Cost and Accessibility**: Free for public repositories and competitively priced for private repositories, making it accessible for a wide range of projects.

GitHub Actions represent a powerful tool in the modern developer's toolkit, offering flexibility and efficiency in automating software development processes.
